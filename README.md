# Reflection
My goal with regard to my course is to learn new knowledge about technology. I believe that learning new technologies can help me stay up-to-date with the latest trends and enhance my skills. Additionally, it can provide me with more opportunities to work on various projects. It's important for software engineers to acquire new skills to maintain interest in this field long-term.

Through this design thinking project, I have learned to be more user-focused when developing a new project. The design thinking process has allowed me to think outside the box and consider uncommon solutions, ultimately resulting in the best possible outcome. Moreover, this approach has emphasized the importance of conducting user research at the start of each project so that we could gain a deeper understanding of user behavior.

I think it is vital to explore collaborative opportunities with professionals from different departments to improve my potential in the industry. These collaborations provide me with a better understanding of how my role fits into the larger organization and expose me to a range of diverse projects. It will help me gain more experience and feedback from my surroundings, which is crucial for my career growth.

# Improvement
1. Instead of Time To Link, our application can be named as Campus Alert since our group's objective is to prevent students from missing out on important information and activities.
2. Admins are needed to filter out all the scam messages and spam notifications.
